## Purpose

In late 2019 and early 2020, Australia was ravaged by a horrifically devastating bushfire season that perished an estimated half-billion living creatures and caused toxic smoke clouds to cover populated cities. The heaviest hits were rural communities and farms, including one organic honey producer that lost over 500 beehives in one tragic day.

Honey Homage, located in eastern NSW had lost almost everything, but through pure grit, patience, and sheer determination following the fierce bushfires; has now cultivated new hives and is now in a position to start selling their organic honey products again.

Being an organic honey producer for almost 60 years, they relied on reputation, word of mouth and repeat wholesale customers to move their products. They don't have an online presence or modern website and because of the bushfires and having to stay out of the market to re-grow; they have become forgotten within the market.

As a passionate team of three with a broad skill set that includes digital marketing, brand identity, design, and full-stack web development; our purpose is to bring Honey Homage online onto a digital market with an optimised online store.
